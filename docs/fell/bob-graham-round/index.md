# Bob Graham Round – GPX Files

The **Bob Graham Round** is a legendary fell running challenge in England’s Lake District. It covers 42 peaks, approximately 106 km (66 miles), and around 8,200 m of ascent—traditionally completed in under 24 hours.

This page provides downloadable GPX files for each leg of the round, as well as complete route options. Choose the format that best suits your GPS device or navigation app. If you're unsure which to use, the **Simplified Route** is a good starting point.

- **Simplified Route** – A single-track GPX file compatible with most GPS devices and apps (e.g. Garmin Connect, Strava). Recommended for general use.
- **Detailed Route** – A multi-track GPX file with each leg as a separate track. Ideal for advanced analysis or editing in tools like [GPX Studio](https://gpx.studio).
