## 🗺️ Route Source

These GPX tracks were created using the **Ordnance Survey (OS) Maps** online route planner. Routes are snapped to existing rights of way and footpaths using OS’s routing algorithm. While they closely follow the traditional Bob Graham Round line, some variations may occur — particularly on technical descents or open fell crossings.

> 🧭 *Runners are advised to compare with race lines, terrain, and satellite imagery before use.*
