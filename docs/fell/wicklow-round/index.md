The **Wicklow Round** is an Irish fell running challenge set in the Wicklow Mountains, often called the "Garden of Ireland." This classic round involves 26 peaks, covers approximately 100 km (62 miles), and includes around 6,000 m of ascent—traditionally completed in under 24 hours.

The Wicklow Round was established as Ireland's contribution to the classic fell running rounds of the British Isles, joining the Bob Graham Round (England), Ramsay Round (Scotland), and Paddy Buckley Round (Wales) to complete the Celtic nations' collection of legendary mountain challenges.

## Route Overview

The route traditionally starts and finishes in Glenmalure, taking in the major peaks of the Wicklow Mountains including:

- **Lugnaquilla** (925m) - Wicklow's highest peak
- **Mullaghcleevaun** (847m)
- **Tonelagee** (817m)
- **Kippure** (757m)
- **Djouce** (725m)
- **Scarr** (641m)

The circuit traverses through some of Ireland's most spectacular mountain scenery, including glacial valleys, corrie lakes, and expansive bog lands that characterize the Wicklow landscape.
