## About Running Routes

This project provides runners with high-quality GPX files tailored for fell, trail, and road running.

### For fell runners:

* Include **all summits** and relevant points of interest (POIs)
* Calculate a **realistic route** using OpenStreetMap data
* Output both a plotted map and a matching GPX file

The key goal is to ensure runners can be confident their route:

* Hits every summit in the intended order
* Follows public footpaths or known tracks
* Contains no unnecessary deviations or detours

### For trail and road runners:

* Provide clean, device-compatible GPX files for popular or curated routes
* Optimise for **accuracy, simplicity**, and **compatibility** with mapping tools
* Ensure tracks align with known paths or roads and avoid GPS errors or detours
