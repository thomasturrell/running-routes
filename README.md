# 🏃 Running Routes

This repository contains the source data, scripts, and site content behind the [Running Routes Website](https://thomasturrell.github.io/running-routes/).

The site offers downloadable GPX files for road, trail, and fell running routes—viewable on interactive maps and available in simplified or detailed formats.

This project provides runners with high-quality GPX files tailored for fell, trail, and road running.


For fell runners:
Include all summits and relevant points of interest (POIs)

Calculate a realistic route using OpenStreetMap data

Output both a plotted map and a matching GPX file

Ensure the route:

Hits every summit in the intended order

Follows public footpaths or known tracks, not straight lines

Contains no unnecessary deviations or detours

For trail and road runners:
Provide clean, device-compatible GPX files for popular or curated routes

Optimise for accuracy, simplicity, and compatibility with mapping tools

Ensure tracks align with known paths or roads and avoid GPS errors or detours
