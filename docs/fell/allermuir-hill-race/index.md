The **Allermuir Hill Race** is a short, steep fell race held annually in the Pentland Hills, south of Edinburgh. Organised by [Carnethy Hill Running Club](http://carnethy.com/carnethy-organised-races/allermuir-hill-race/), the race follows an out-and-back route from Lothianburn, climbing to the summit of Allermuir Hill before returning the same way. 

The course visits two summits — **Caerketton Hill** and **Allermuir Hill** — and passes the **Jonny Reynolds sunflower bench** along the way. It provides a compact test of climbing and descending ability and is suitable for both experienced and newer hill runners.

- **Distance:** ~7 km  
- **Ascent:** ~400 m  
- **Start/Finish:** Lothianburn  
- **Terrain:** Grassy trails and open hillside  
- **Features:** No course marking or prizes; runners are expected to be self-reliant and aware of the route
