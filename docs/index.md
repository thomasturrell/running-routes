The **Bob Graham Round** is a legendary fell running challenge in England’s Lake District. It covers 42 peaks, approximately 106 km (66 miles), and around 8,200 m of ascent—traditionally completed in under 24 hours.

- **Detailed Route** – A multi-track GPX file with each leg as a separate track. Ideal for advanced analysis or editing in tools like [GPX Studio](https://gpx.studio).
