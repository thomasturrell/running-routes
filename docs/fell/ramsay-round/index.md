The **Ramsay Round** is a classic Scottish fell running challenge in the Lochaber region. It includes 24 Munros, covers approximately 93 km (58 miles), and involves over 8,500 m of ascent—traditionally completed in under 24 hours.

Multiple formats are available to suit different devices and use cases. If unsure, start with the **Simplified Route**, which is compatible with most GPS watches and mobile apps (e.g. Garmin Connect, Strava).
