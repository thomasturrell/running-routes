The **Wicklow Round** is an Irish fell running challenge set in the Wicklow Mountains, often called the "Garden of Ireland." This classic round involves 26 peaks, covers approximately 100 km (62 miles), and includes around 6,000 m of ascent‚Äîtraditionally completed in under 24 hours.

The Wicklow Round was established as Ireland's contribution to the classic fell running rounds of the British Isles, joining the Bob Graham Round (England), Ramsay Round (Scotland), and Paddy Buckley Round (Wales) to complete the Celtic nations' collection of legendary mountain challenges.

## Route Overview

The route traditionally starts and finishes in Glenmalure, taking in the major peaks of the Wicklow Mountains including:

- **Lugnaquilla** (925m) - Wicklow's highest peak
- **Mullaghcleevaun** (847m)
- **Tonelagee** (817m)
- **Kippure** (757m)
- **Djouce** (725m)
- **Scarr** (641m)

The circuit traverses through some of Ireland's most spectacular mountain scenery, including glacial valleys, corrie lakes, and expansive bog lands that characterize the Wicklow landscape.

## Challenge Details

**Ascent:** ~6,000 m

## History

The Wicklow Round follows the tradition established by Bob Graham's 1932 Lake District circuit, adapted for the unique terrain and character of the Wicklow Mountains. The route showcases the geological diversity of the region, from the granite peaks of the higher summits to the schist formations of the eastern ranges.

## Navigation Notes

The Wicklow Mountains present unique navigation challenges including:
- Extensive bog areas requiring careful route selection
- Weather that can change rapidly
- Limited infrastructure compared to other mountain regions
- Several river crossings depending on conditions

## Safety Considerations

As with all classic rounds, the Wicklow Round requires:
- Extensive mountain experience and navigation skills
- Proper equipment for Irish mountain conditions
- Knowledge of emergency procedures and escape routes
- Understanding of local weather patterns
- Proper support crew coordination

Multiple formats are available to suit different devices and use cases. If unsure, start with the **Simplified Route**, which is compatible with most GPS watches and mobile apps (e.g. Garmin Connect, Strava).
