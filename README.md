# Running Routes
This repository contains a collection of .gpx files for different types of running, including:

* 🛣️ Road running – Fast, paved routes ideal for tempo runs, intervals, and race preparation
* 🏞️ Trail running – Scenic off-road routes through forests, hills, and countryside paths
* ⛰️ Fell running – Steep, rugged mountain routes with a focus on elevation and summits

All routes are provided in GPX format and can be used with GPS watches and mapping apps like Garmin, Suunto, Strava, Komoot, and OS Maps.
